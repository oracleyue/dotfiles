(autoload 'key-combo-define "key-combo" "\
In KEYMAP, define key sequence KEY as COMMANDS.
KEYMAP is a keymap.

KEY is a string or a vector of symbols and characters meaning a
sequence of keystrokes and events.  Non-ASCII characters with codes
above 127 (such as ISO Latin-1) can be included if you use a vector.

COMMANDS can be an interactive function, a string, nil, or list of these COMMAND.
If COMMANDS is string, treated as a smartchr flavor keyboard macro.
If COMMANDS is nil, the key-chord is removed.
If COMMANDS is list, treated as sequential commands.

\(fn KEYMAP KEY COMMANDS)" nil nil)

(autoload 'key-combo-define-global "key-combo" "\
Give KEY a global binding as COMMAND.

See also `key-combo-define'

Note that if KEY has a local binding in the current buffer,
that local binding will continue to shadow any global binding
that you make with this function.

\(fn KEYS COMMAND)" nil nil)

(autoload 'key-combo-define-local "key-combo" "\
Give KEY a local binding as COMMAND.

See also `key-combo-define'

The binding goes in the current buffer's local map,
which in most cases is shared with all other buffers in the same major mode.

Toggle Key-Combo mode in all buffers.
With prefix ARG, enable Global-Key-Combo mode if ARG is positive;
otherwise, disable it.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode if
ARG is omitted or nil.

Key-Combo mode is enabled in all buffers where
`key-combo-mode-maybe' would do it.
See `key-combo-mode' for more information on Key-Combo mode.
