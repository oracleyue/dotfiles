Dear Associate Editor and Reviewers,

We would like to deeply thank you for reviewing our paper and providing
us with constructive comments and suggestions. We have carefully
addressed all the comments and incorporated them into the revised
manuscript. According to the reviewersâ€™ suggestions, we omitted the
section on the synthesis and its related case study in order to make the
paper brief. We have also added some remarks and discussions on the
issues mentioned by the reviewers, re-organized the paper, and brought
the definition of the system we are dealing with into the very beginning
of the paper. We present below a detailed discussion of all comments,
questions, and concerns raised by the reviewers. The major modifications
are highlighted in blue in the revised manuscript. We also use
\textcolor{blue}{blue} and \textcolor{red}{red} colors in the response
letter for referring to the current changes throughout the revised
manuscript, and the previous version, respectively.

With kind regards,\\
AuthorName1, AuthorName2, AuthorName3
