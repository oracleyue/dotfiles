<code>ecb-new-ecb-frame</code> is not nil (otherwise this hook is not
evaluated).

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-advice_002dwindow_002dfunctions_002dsignal_002derror"></a>User Option: <strong>advice-window-functions-signal-error</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Signal an error if an adviced function can not do its job. If not nil
then an error is signaled if one of the adviced user-commands can not
do its job. So for example if the user tries to split the
compile-window or an ecb-tree-window or if one tries to switch to
another buffer in one of the ecb-tree-windows. For details see the
documentation of each of the adviced functions to get info when an
error is signaled.
</p>
<p>If this option is nil then no error is signaled but the called adviced
function does simply nothing.
</p>
<p>Default is nil but it can also be useful to signal errors - so you see
when call a function in a situation which is not supported by this
function.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-fix_002dwindow_002dsize"></a>User Option: <strong>fix-window-size</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Fix size of the ECB-windows/buffers even after frame-resizing. The fix
type (valid values are nil, t, width and height) can either be set on
a layout-basis (means a different value for each layout) or one value
can be set for all layouts. For the latter case there is an additional
value <code>auto</code> which choose autom. the senseful fix-type depending
on the current layout-type: For top-layouts the fix-type <code>height</code>
and for all other layout-types the fix-type <code>width</code>.
</p>
<p>For a detailed description of the valid values see documentation of
<code>window-size-fixed</code> which is newly introduced in GNU Emacs 21 and
is only available there. Therefore this option takes only effect with
GNU Emacs &gt;= 21. This option has no effect with XEmacs because it does
not support the feature <code>window-size-fixed</code>.
</p>
<p>Note1: Manually resizing the ECB-windows via <code>enlarge-window</code>,
<code>shrink-window</code>, <code>mouse-drag-vertical-line</code> and
<code>mouse-drag-mode-line</code> is still possible even if the window-sizes
are fixed for frame-resizing!
</p>
<p>Note2: The description of <code>window-size-fixed</code> in the
elisp-info-manual is more detailed than the description offered by
<kbd>C-h v</kbd>!
</p>
<p>Note3: With Emacs &lt; 22 there seems to be no distinction between
&rsquo;width, &rsquo;height and t. Therefore this option takes no effect (means
all ecb-windows have always unfixed sizes) with Emacs &lt; 22 if
<code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is not nil.
</p>
<p>Per default no window-size fixing has been done.

<p>IMPORTANT: Hiding the ECB-windows is internally done by calling

<dt><a name="index-ignore_002ddisplay_002dbuffer_002dfunction"></a>User Option: <strong>ignore-display-buffer-function</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Adviced <code>display-buffer</code> ignores <code>display-buffer-function</code>.
This means, that the adviced version of <code>display-buffer</code> ignores
the value of <code>display-buffer-function</code> when called for the
<code>ecb-frame</code>. If this variable should not be ignored then the
function of <code>display-buffer-function</code> is completely responsible
which window is used for the buffer to display - no smart ECB-logic
will help to deal best with the ECB-window-layout! You can define if
and when <code>display-buffer-function</code> should be ignored:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- only when persistent compile window is used - i.e. if
<code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is not nil

</li><li>- always when ECB is active - that means ignore when ECB is active
otherwise not - this is the default value

</li><li>- never, the adviced version of <code>display-buffer</code> always uses the
value of <code>display-buffer-function</code> if the value is a function.
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-ignore_002dpop_002dup_002dframes"></a>User Option: <strong>ignore-pop-up-frames</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Ignore setting of option <code>pop-up-frames</code>.
This means, that a value of not nil for <code>pop-up-frames</code> is ignored:
</p><ul>
<li> &rsquo;compile-window: only when persistent compile window is used - i.e. if
<code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is not nil - this is the default value.
</li><li> &rsquo;always: always when ECB is active - that means no pop-up-frames when ECB is active
</li><li> <code>nil</code>: pop-up-frames is fully active when set
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-ignore_002dspecial_002ddisplay"></a>User Option: <strong>ignore-special-display</strong></dt>

and <code>special-display-regexps</code> are ignored
</p>
<ul>
<li> only when persistent compile window is used - i.e. if
<code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is not nil - this is the default
value.

</li><li> always when ECB is active - that means no special-display-handling of
buffers when ECB is active

</li><li> never, i.e. special-dislay-handling depends on the values of the
options <code>special-display-function</code>,
<code>special-display-buffer-names</code> and

<dt><a name="index-layout_002dalways_002doperate_002din_002dedit_002dwindow"></a>User Option: <strong>layout-always-operate-in-edit-window</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Adviced window functions work always in the edit-window. If we are in
an ECB special buffer (methods, directories, etc), and any of the
adviced windowing functions is called interactively, we will select
first an edit-window according to the value of
<code>ecb-mouse-click-destination</code>. This is useful if you have any
functions that use such functions and you don&rsquo;t want them to fail with
an error complaining that the current buffer can not be split, or
something similar.
</p>
<p>Because this may not be desirable in all situations and for all
adviced functions this can be enabled separately for function where it
is senseful. If the symbol of an adviced function is contained in the
value of this option, then the edit-window is first selected otherwise
either an error is reported or some other special reaction (depends on
<code>ecb-advice-window-functions-signal-error</code>); see the
documentation of the adviced functions for this.
</p>
<p>Per default this is only enabled for <code>switch-to-buffer</code>.
</p></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dt><a name="index-layout_002ddebug_002dmode"></a>User Option: <strong>layout-debug-mode</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Write debug-information about layout-operations in the
Messages-buffer. Normally there should be no need to set this option
to true but if there are problems to display buffers in the
compile-window of ECB (e.g. buffers which should be displayed there
aren&rsquo;t or the temporally enlarging-mechanism does not do what you
think it should do etc...) then please do the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Set <code>ecb-layout-debug-mode</code> to not nil

</li><li> Reproduce the wrong behavior exactly by repeating all the operations
which lead to the problem.

</li><li> Now send immediately a bug report with
<code>ecb-submit-problem-report</code>.

</li><li> Set <code>ecb-layout-debug-mode</code> back to nil if you do not want
further debugging output in the *Messages* buffer
</li></ol>
</dd></dl>



<dl>
<dt><a name="index-layout_002dname"></a>User Option: <strong>layout-name</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Select a window layout of ECB. Value is any arbitrary string. There are
four different types of layouts: left, right, top and left-right,
which means the location of the ECB-tree-windows in the ECB-frame.
Currently there are 20 predefined layouts; names see below. You can
savely try out any of them by changing this value and saving it only
for the current session. If you are sure which layout you want you can
save it for future sessions. To get a picture of the layout for name
&lt;name&gt; call &lsquo;ecb-show-layout-help&rsquo;. <code>ecb-layout-function-9</code>.
</p>
<p>Currently available layouts:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Left layouts:
left1 left2 left3 left4 left5 left6 left7 left8 left9 left10 left11
left12 left13 left14 left15

</li><li> Right layouts:
right1

</li><li> Top layouts:
top1 top2

</li><li> Left-right layouts:
leftright1 leftright2
</li></ul>

<p>Regardless of the settings you define here: If you have destroyed or
changed the ECB-screen-layout by any action you can always go back to
this layout with <code>ecb-redraw-layout</code>
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-layout_002dwindow_002dsizes"></a>User Option: <strong>layout-window-sizes</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies the sizes of the ECB windows for each layout.
The easiest way (and also the very strongly recommended way) to set this
option is to change the window sizes by dragging the window borders using
the mouse and then store the window sizes by calling the command
<code>ecb-store-window-sizes</code>. Next time the layout is redrawn the values stored in
this option will be used.
</p>
<p>If <code>ecb-store-window-sizes</code> is used then the windows sizes are stored per
default as fractions of current frame-width and -height of the ecb-frame, so
the stored values will &ldquo;work&rdquo; for other frame sizes too. But if you call
<code>ecb-store-window-sizes</code> with a prefix-argument then the fixed values of
current width and height are stored!
</p>
<p>If this option is set &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; (i.e. not by <code>ecb-store-window-sizes</code>) then
the following is important:
</p><ul>
<li> Use always <code>customize-option</code>, never <code>setq</code>!
</li><li> It is recommended to use fractions of frame-width and -height!.
</li><li> It is also recommended to use buffer-name-symbols instead of plain
buffer-names (e.g. ecb-history-buffer-name instead of &quot; *ECB History*&rdquo;)
</li><li> There must be an entry for each special ecb-buffer of that layout for which
the sizes are stored.
</li><li> The order of the sequence of the inserted window sizes doesn&rsquo;t matter
because each size-pair is assigned to a buffer-name the sizes belong to.
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-maximize_002decb_002dwindow_002dafter_002dselection"></a>User Option: <strong>maximize-ecb-window-after-selection</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If not nil maximize current tree-window after selection. When
selecting another not-tree-window after such an automatic maximizing
all tree-windows of current layout are displayed again. But a
tree-window is not maximized if either a node has been selected via
primary- oder secondarc mouse-button or the popup-menu of that
tree-buffer has been opened.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-maximize_002dnext_002dafter_002dmaximized_002dselect"></a>User Option: <strong>maximize-next-after-maximized-select</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Maximizes the next logical tree-window after a maximized
node-selection. Selecting a node in a maximized tree-window is handled
very smart by ECB:
</p>
<p>If a tree-buffer-name is not contained in this option then selecting a
node in this maximized tree-buffer automatically &ldquo;minimizes&rdquo; that
tree-window (i.e. displays all windows of the current layout) so the
user can perform the next logical step (e.g. the next logical step
after selecting a directory in the directories-buffer is to select a
source-file - therefore the sources-buffer of current layout has to be
displayed - if the current layout contains one; the next logical step
of selecting a source-file is probably to jump to a certain tag via
the methods-buffer).
</p>
<p>If a tree-buffer-name is contained in this option then selecting a
node in this tree-buffer automatically maximizes the next logical
tree-window (e.g. directories &ndash;&gt; sources, sources/history &ndash;&gt;
methods). But if the current maximized tree-buffer is also contained
in the option <code>ecb-tree-do-not-leave-window-after-select</code> (see
also the tree-buffer-command
<code>ecb-toggle-do-not-leave-window-after-select</code> which is bound to
<code>C-t</code> in each tree-buffer) then ECB does *not* maximize the next
logical tree-window but point stays in the currently maximized
tree-buffer so for example the user can select more than one node
(e.g. more than one source-file from the sources-buffer.
</p>
<p>The tree-buffer-name can either be defined as plain string or with a
symbol which contains the buffer-name as value. The latter one is
recommended for the builtin ECB-tree-buffers because then simply the
related option-symbol can be used (e.g.
<code>ecb-directories-buffer-name</code>, <code>ecb-sources-buffer-name</code> or
<code>ecb-history-buffer-name</code>).
</p>
<p>In future versions this option will probably also allow to define the
next logical tree-buffer for a tree-buffer - currently this is
hard-coded as follows:
</p><ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- directories &ndash;next-logical&ndash;&gt; sources
</li><li>- sources     &ndash;next-logical&ndash;&gt; methods
</li><li>- history     &ndash;next-logical&ndash;&gt; methods.
</li></ul>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-maximize_002dnext_002dafter_002dmaximized_002dselect-1"></a>User Option: <strong>maximize-next-after-maximized-select</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Maximizes the next logical tree-window after a maximized
node-selection. Selecting a node in a maximized tree-window is handled
very smart by ECB:
</p>
<p>If this option is nil then selecting a node in a maximized
directories- sources- or history-tree-buffer automatically
&ldquo;minimizes&rdquo; that tree-window (i.e. displays all windows of the
current layout) so the user can perform the next logical step (e.g.
the next logical step after selecting a directory in the
directories-buffer is to select a source-file - therefore the
sources-buffer of current layout has to be displayed - if the current

is probably to jump to a certain tag via the methods-buffer).
</p>
<p>If this option is not nil then selecting a node in a maximized
directories- sources- or history-tree-buffer automatically maximizes
the next logical tree-window (directories &ndash;&gt; sources, sources/history
&ndash;&gt; methods). But if the current maximized tree-buffer is contained in
the option <code>ecb-tree-do-not-leave-window-after-select</code> (see also
the tree-buffer-command
<code>ecb-toggle-do-not-leave-window-after-select</code> which is bound to

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-other_002dwindow_002dbehavior"></a>User Option: <strong>other-window-behavior</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The behavior of ECB concerning getting an &ldquo;other window&rdquo;. The
following settings are possible:
</p>
<p><code>all</code>:
</p>
<p>ECB will cycle through all windows of the ECB-frame or scroll simply
the next window in the ECB-frame, means it behaves like the original
<code>other-window</code> rsp. the original
<code>other-window-for-scrolling</code>.
</p>
<p><code>only-edit</code>:
</p>
<p>ECB will only cycle through the edit-windows of ECB or only scroll
another edit-window. If the selected window is not an edit-window then
it behaves like with value <code>all</code>.
</p>
<p><code>edit-and-compile</code>:
</p>
<p>Like <code>only-edit</code> plus the compile window if any. If the selected
window is neither an edit-window nor the compile-window then it
behaves like with value <code>all</code>.
</p>
<p><code>smart</code>:
</p>
<p>With this setting ECB tries to choose the
<code>other-window</code>-destination or the &ldquo;other window&rdquo; to scroll in a
smart and intuitive way: If point is in one of the edit-windows and if
the edit-area is splitted then always the &ldquo;next&rdquo; edit-window is
choosen (whereas the next edit-window of the last edit-window is the
first edit-window)- if the edit-area is unsplitted then the
compile-window is used if there is one. In the context of an
<code>other-window</code>-call the <var>ARG</var> of <code>other-window</code> will be
taken into account.
</p>
<p>If one of the special ecb-windows is selected then always the &ldquo;next&rdquo;
ecb-window is choosen (whereas the next ecb-window of the last
ecb-window is the first ecb-window). In the context of an
<code>other-window</code>-call the <var>ARG</var> of <code>other-window</code> will be
taken into account. If there is only one ecb-window then ECB considers
also the edit-windows
</p>
<p>If the compile-window is selected then always the last edit-window
which had the point will be used unless <code>other-window</code> has been
called with a prefix-argument unequal 1.
</p>
<p>If there is an active minibuffer:
</p>
<p>Regardless of the allowed values above ECB handles the situation of an
active minibuffer during a call to <code>other-window</code> or
<code>scroll-other-window</code> like follows:
</p>
<p>If the minibuffer-window is selected then ECB always chooses the
window <code>minibuffer-scroll-window</code> points to (when this variable
is set, otherwise the compile-window or the last selected edit-window
is choosen) when the called command is called to choose the 1. next
window (always true for scrolling another window or true when
<code>other-window</code> called without prefix-arg or with prefix-arg equal
1). Otherwise the window ARG steps away is choosen (in case of
<code>other-window</code>).
</p>
<p>If there is an active minibuffer but the minibuffer-window is not
selected then <code>other-window</code> and <code>scroll-other-window</code>
behave like the original version.
</p>
<p>In addition to the allowed values above the value of this option can
also be a function:
</p>
<p>A function:
</p>
<p>This function gets seven arguments:
</p><ol>
<li> A canonical list of all currently visible windows of the
<code>ecb-frame</code>
</li><li> A canonical list of all currently visible edit-windows
</li><li> A canonical list of all currently visible ecb-windows
</li><li> The window-object of the compile-window if there is any.
</li><li> The minibuffer-window of the ECB-frame if there is an active
minibuffer.
</li><li> The result of the function <code>ecb-where-is-point</code> - see the
documentation of this function for details.
</li><li> An integer which indicates how many steps away from the current
selected window the &ldquo;other-window&rdquo; is. Is nil when this function is
called in another context then for <code>other-window</code>.
</li></ol>

<p>The function has to return a window-object which is then used as
&ldquo;other window&rdquo; for the command <code>other-window</code> or for scrolling
another window (e.g. with <code>scroll-other-window</code>). Such a function
has to handle properly all situation for itself.
<code>ecb-get-other-window-smart</code> is an example for such a function.

<dd><p>Hooks run direct before the ECB windows will be shown either by
<code>ecb-toggle-ecb-windows</code> or <code>ecb-show-ecb-windows</code>. This
means that at runtime of this hook the ECB-windows are still hidden.
</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Showing the hidden ECB-windows is internally done by
calling <code>ecb-redraw-layout</code> and therefore also the hooks
<code>ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook</code> and
<code>ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook</code> are evaluated. So there is the
following sequence of hooks during the process of showing the hidden
ECB-windows:
</p><ol>
<li> <code>ecb-show-ecb-windows-before-hook</code>
</li><li> <code>ecb-redraw-layout-before-hook</code>
</li><li> &lt;redrawing the layout to show the hidden ECB-windows&gt;
</li><li> <code>ecb-redraw-layout-after-hook</code>
</li><li> <code>ecb-show-ecb-windows-after-hook</code>
</li></ol>
<p>So be aware which code you add to which hook!

<dt><a name="index-split_002dedit_002dwindow_002dafter_002dstart"></a>User Option: <strong>split-edit-window-after-start</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Sets if and how the edit window should be splitted after ECB-start.
But be aware: This option determines only if and how the edit-window
should be splitted at start-time of ECB. There are five different
values allowed for this option:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- <code>nil</code>:
Do not split the edit-area of ECB after activation, i.e. there will be
only one edit-window after starting ECB.

</li><li>- <code>horizontal</code>:
Split the edit-area in 2 edit-windows side by side.

</li><li>- <code>vertical</code>:
Split the edit-area in 2 edit-windows, one above the other.

</li><li>- <code>before-activation</code>:
Split the edit-area as before the ECB-start, i.e. the edit-area will
have after start a window-layout as the whole frame had before the
start of ECB.

</li><li>- <code>before-deactivation</code>:
Split the edit-area into a window-layout ECB had in its edit-area
direct before the ECB-deactivation. This value preserves the full
state between activations of ECB, i.e. the visibility of the
ECB-windows, the visibility of a compile-window and also the full
split-state of the edit-area. But this can only be done if important
layout-options have not been changed in the meanwhile. These are the
options <code>ecb-layout-name</code>, <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code>,
<code>ecb-compile-window-width</code>, <code>ecb-windows-width</code> and
<code>ecb-windows-height</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>Default value is <code>before-deactivation</code>.
</p>
<p>Some remarks to the value <code>before-activation</code>: If this value has
been set then ECB needs three permanent adivces even when ECB is
deactivated: <code>split-window</code>, <code>delete-window</code> and
<code>delete-other-windows</code>. But these advices do not change any
behavior of these functions but only storing in an internal
ECB-variable the facts that a window has been splitted or deleted. In
addition to this these advices are 100% error-save, means the
functionality of the original functions will be performed in every(!)
case even if within the advice an error occurs (but normally there can
no errors occur in these advices because they are very simple).
Conclusion: If you want really all ECB-advices being disabled after
deactivating ECB then you have to set this option to other values then
<code>before-activation</code>. But setting this variable to this value is
really completely save.

<dt><a name="index-toggle_002dlayout_002dsequence"></a>User Option: <strong>toggle-layout-sequence</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Toggle sequence for layout toggling with <code>ecb-toggle-layout</code>.
Every element of this list has to be a valid layout-name i.e. either
one of the predefined layouts or one of the user-defined layouts.
</p>
<p>You can add here as many layouts as you want but to use this option
most effective you should not add more than 2 or 3 layouts so every
layout can be accessed very fast by toggling with
<code>ecb-toggle-layout</code>. It is also senseful to add layouts which
have the same principal outline, i.e. all their tree-buffers are on
the same side of the frame and the tree-buffer-&rdquo;column&rdquo; (or
-&rdquo;row&rdquo;) has identical size for the layouts.
</p>
<p>Recommended values are for example:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- (&ldquo;left10&rdquo; &ldquo;left15&rdquo;), toggles between methods and directories/history
</li><li>- (&ldquo;left10&rdquo; &ldquo;left13&rdquo;), toggles between methods and directories
</li><li>- (&ldquo;left10&rdquo; &ldquo;left14&rdquo;), toggles between methods and history
</li><li>- (&ldquo;left10&rdquo; &ldquo;left13&rdquo; &ldquo;left14&rdquo;), toggles between methods, history and directories
</li></ul>

<p>See also option <code>ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer</code>.
</p>
<p>This option makes only sense if the value is a list with more than 1
element!
