<h4 class="subsection">6.6.4 Updating the Methods-window with contents of current source-buffer</h4>

<p>First a preliminary remark: Do not confuse this chapter with that
synchronizing described in <a href="ECB_002dwindow-synchronizing.html#ECB_002dwindow-synchronizing">ECB-window synchronizing</a>. The latter one
describes the mechanism for synchronizing the ECB-windows when the
current-buffer in the edit-area has been changed. This chapter describes how
to update the ECB-methods-window with the contents of the current-buffer
if the buffer has been modified!
</p>
<a name="The-short-version"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">6.6.4.1 The short version</h4>

<p>In almost all cases there is <strong>NO</strong> need to manually rebuild the
method-buffer, because it is always done automatically if necessary;
the mechanism depends on the sources:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- semantic-sources:
The command <code>global-semantic-idle-scheduler-mode</code> switches on autom.
reparsing of semantic-sources. All the rest will be done by semantic and ECB
automatically. ECB and semantic always try to reparse and update as less as
possible of the sourcecode-buffer.

</li><li>- non-semantic-sources (imenu supported):
You can switch on autom. rescanning/reparsing with the option
<code>imenu-auto-rescan</code>. But nevertheless you have to manually
rebuild the Method-buffer (with the autom. updated imenu-tags) via the
command <code>ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer</code> (bound to <kbd>C-c . r</kbd>).

</li><li>- non-semantic-sources (etags supported):
For these sources there is no built-in auto-rescan mechanism, because
etags is an external tool it can only operate on the saved
file-contents. So rescanning the buffer contents would need to save
the buffer before. Therefore there is no built-in auto-rescan mechanism
because this would always result in saving the buffer and running an
external tool. But of course you can program such a an
etags-auto-rescan mechanism for yourself!
</li></ul>

<a name="The-full-and-long-story"></a>
<h4 class="subsubsection">6.6.4.2 The full and long story</h4>

<p>Generally ECB calls semantic to get the list of tags for current source-file
of current edit-window. Per default ECB does never automatically force a
reparse of the source-file after this has been changed - this is only done on
demand by calling the command <code>ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer</code>. So per
default the idle-scheduler of semantic is responsible for reparsing the
source-file when this is necessary (see &lsquo;semantic-idle-scheduler-mode&rsquo; for
further details). So this scheduler is also responsible when
updating/sychronizing the methods-window with current buffer-contents. This is
the most user-resonsible and therefore the recommended approach.
</p>
<p>ECB is responsible to update the methods-window after the idle scheduler of
semantic has triggered either a full or partial reparse of the source-buffer.
Semantic always tries to reparse as less tags of the buffer as possible, often
just the edited section (if it has no sideeffect to tags outside the edited
parts). ECB handles this partial reparse output smoothly and updates only
these nodes which are releated to the reparsed tags.
</p>
<p>The main effect a user will notice is that edit actions which trigger just a
partial reparse will just update the related node in the methods-window and
not the whole methods-window. One of the main advantages is that this
preserves the expand/collapse state of the methods-window.
</p>
<p>Editing examples which trigger only a partial reparse:
</p><ul>
<li> editing a function- or method-body
</li><li> changing the name of a variable or function/method
</li><li> modifying the return-type of a function/method
</li><li> and some other...
</li></ul>

<p>In these cases only the related node in the methods-window will change
nothing else, ie. the expand/collapse-states of all other nodes in the
methods-window will not be changed.
</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: It&rsquo;s strongly recommended to enable
<code>semantic-idle-scheduler-mode</code> or
<code>global-semantic-idle-scheduler-mode</code> (see <a href="Setting-up-CEDET_002fsemantic.html#Setting-up-CEDET_002fsemantic">Setting up CEDET/semantic</a>)
because then reparsing is always done during idle-time of Emacs and - maybe
even more important - it is also interruptable.
</p>
<p>But if this idle-scheduler is switched off then ECB offers now two
possibilities (via <code>ecb-force-reparse-when-semantic-idle-scheduler-off</code>):
</p>
<ul>
<li> 
Not forcing itself a reparse when tags are needed by ECB: then a user declines
knowingly Emacs/semantic-driven parsing of code when he/she switches off the
idle-mode of semantic. This is the default behavior of ECB and the default
value of this option. But this has also the consequence that the
methods-buffer is only filed on demand via <code>ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer</code>
(bound to <tt class="key">C-c . r</tt>)!

<p>This means also in consequence that the methods-buffer is not
automatically filled when a source-file is opened but first on demand
after calling the command <code>ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer</code>!
</p>
</li><li> 
Forcing a reparse when tags are needed: Then ECB forces semantic to parse
the source-file when ECB needs tags to display. For this behavior this
option has to be set to not nil.
</li></ul>

<p>The term &ldquo;forcing a reparse by semantic&rdquo; is a simplification: ECB uses then
the function <code>semantic-fetch-tags</code> which can decide that the cached tags
are up-to-date so no real reparsing is necessary - but it can also run a full
reparse and this reparse is not being done when Emacs is idle but immediatelly
and not interruptable (as with the idle-scheduler of semantic), which can be
quite annoying with big source-files.
</p>
<p>To make a long story short: It is strongly recommended to enable the
<code>semantic-idle-scheduler-mode</code> or
<code>global-semantic-idle-scheduler-mode</code>! See <a href="Setting-up-CEDET_002fsemantic.html#Setting-up-CEDET_002fsemantic">Setting up CEDET/semantic</a>. This will give you in all cases the behavior you would expect
of an IDE like ECB/semantic.
