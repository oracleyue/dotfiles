<h3 class="section">6.14 Interactive ECB commands</h3>

<p>ECB offers a lot of interactive commands. Some of these commands
prompt the user in the minibuffer if called with a prefix argument.
</p>
<p>Example: If <code>ecb-clear-history</code> is called with a prefix argument
then you will be prompted in the minibuffer with:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Clear from history: [all, not-existing-buffers, existing-buffers]
</pre></div>

<p>You can choose one of the options enclosed in brackets with
TAB-completion; hitting RET direct after the prompt chooses auto. the
first offered option (in the example above &ldquo;all&rdquo;).
</p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong>: The following interactive commands of ECB are
listed without the prefix &ldquo;ecb-&rdquo; (e.g. the command
<code>ecb-activate</code> is listed with name &ldquo;activate&rdquo;). This has been
done for a better readable command index. See <a href="Command-Index.html#Command-Index">Command Index</a>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-activate"></a>Command: <strong>activate</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Activates ECB and creates the special buffers for the choosen layout.
For the layout see <code>ecb-layout-name</code>. This function always raises
the ECB-frame if called from another frame. This is the same as
calling <code>ecb-minor-mode</code> with a positive argument.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-add_002dall_002dbuffers_002dto_002dhistory"></a>Command: <strong>add-all-buffers-to-history</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Add all current file-buffers to the history-buffer of ECB.
Dependend on the values of <code>ecb-history-make-buckets</code> and
<code>ecb-history-sort-method</code> afterwards the history is bucketized or
not and sorted either by name or by extension (if bucketized
then the sorting is only within each bucket). If
<code>ecb-history-sort-method</code> is nil the most recently used buffers
are on the top of the history and the seldom used buffers at the
bottom (again: when bucketized then this holds only within each
bucket).
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-analyse_002dbuffer_002dsync"></a>Command: <strong>analyse-buffer-sync</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Synchronize the analyse buffer with the current buffer and point. This
means in fact display the current analysis for current point.
</p></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dt><a name="index-change_002dlayout"></a>Command: <strong>change-layout</strong> <em>&amp;optional preselect-type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Select a layout-name from all current available layouts
(TAB-completion is offered) and change the layout to the selected
layout-name. If optional argument PRESELECT-TYPE is not nil then you
can preselect a layout-type \(TAB-completion is offered too) and then
you will be asked only for layouts of that preselected type. Note:
This function works by changing the option <code>ecb-layout-name</code> but
only for current Emacs-session.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-clear_002dhistory"></a>Command: <strong>clear-history</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Clears the history-buffer.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-customize"></a>Command: <strong>customize</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Open a customize-buffer for all customize-groups of ECB.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-customize_002dmost_002dimportant"></a>Command: <strong>customize-most-important</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Open a customize-buffer for the most important options of ECB.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-create_002dnew_002dlayout"></a>Command: <strong>create-new-layout</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Start process for interactively creating a new ECB-layout
(see <a href="Creating-a-new-ECB_002dlayout.html#Creating-a-new-ECB_002dlayout">Creating a new ECB-layout</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-cycle_002dmaximized_002decb_002dbuffers"></a>Command: <strong>cycle-maximized-ecb-buffers</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Cycles through all ecb-buffers of current layout by maximizing exactly
one of the ecb-windows after every cycle-step.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-cycle_002dthrough_002dcompilation_002dbuffers"></a>Command: <strong>cycle-through-compilation-buffers</strong> <em>&amp;optional choose-buffer</em></dt>
<dd><p>Cycle through all compilation buffers currently open and display them
within the compilation window <code>ecb-compile-window</code>. If the
currently opened buffer within the compilation window is not a
compilation buffer, we jump to the first compilation buffer. If not we
try to loop through all compilation buffers. If we hit the end we go
back to the beginning.
</p>
<p>If <var>CHOOSE-BUFFER</var> is not <code>nil</code> then the user will be
prompted for the compilation-buffer to switch to.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-deactivate"></a>Command: <strong>deactivate</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Deactivates the ECB and kills all ECB buffers and windows.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-delete_002dnew_002dlayout"></a>Command: <strong>delete-new-layout</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Select a layout-name for a layout created by
<code>ecb-create-new-layout</code> and delete this layout. This means the
layout-definition is removed from the file
<code>ecb-create-layout-file</code> and the layout-function and associated
aliases are unbound.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-display_002dnews_002dfor_002dupgrade"></a>Command: <strong>display-news-for-upgrade</strong> <em>&amp;optional FULL-NEWS</em></dt>
<dd><p>Display the most important NEWS after an ECB-upgrade. If you call this
function but no ECB-upgrade has been performed before starting ECB
then nothing is display unless <var>FULL-NEWS</var> is not nil.
</p>
<p>If <var>FULL-NEWS</var> is not nil then the NEWS-file is displayed in
another window.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-display_002dupgraded_002doptions"></a>Command: <strong>display-upgraded-options</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Display a information-buffer which options have been upgraded or
reset. Offers two buttons where the user can decide if the upgraded
options should also being saved by ECB for future settings or if the
buffer should be killed.
</p>
<p>If saving is possible this command display where the options would be
saved. It is that file Emacs uses to save customize-settings. This
file is &ldquo;computed&rdquo; from the settings in <code>custom-file</code> and
<code>user-init-file</code> (see the documentation of these variables).
</p>
<p>ECB automatically makes a backup-file of that file which will be
modified by storing the upgraded rsp. renamed ECB-options. This backup
file gets a unique name by adding a suffix &ldquo;.before_ecb_&lt;version&gt;&rdquo;
to the name of the modified file. If such a file already exists ECB
adds a unique number to the end of the filename to make the filename
unique. This is a safety mechanism if something fails during storing
the upgraded options, so you never lose the contents of your
customization-file!
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-expand_002dmethods_002dnodes"></a>Command: <strong>expand-methods-nodes</strong> <em>&amp;optional force-all</em></dt>
<dd><p>Set the expand level of the nodes in the ECB-methods-buffer.
</p>
<p>This command asks in the minibuffer for an indentation level LEVEL. With this
LEVEL you can precisely specify which level of nodes should be expanded. LEVEL
means the indentation-level of the nodes.
</p>
<p>A LEVEL value X means that all nodes with an indentation-level &lt;= X are
expanded and all other are collapsed. A negative LEVEL value means all visible
nodes are collapsed.
</p>
<p>Nodes which are not indented have indentation-level 0!
</p>
<p>Which node-types are expanded (rsp. collapsed) by this command
depends on the options <code>ecb-methods-nodes-expand-spec</code> and
<code>ecb-methods-nodes-collapse-spec</code>! With optional argument
<var>FORCE-ALL</var> all tags will be expanded/collapsed regardless of
the values of these options.
</p>
<p>Examples:
</p><ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- LEVEL = 0
expands only nodes which have no indentation itself.
</li><li>- LEVEL = 2
expands nodes which are either not indented or indented indented once
or twice
</li><li>- LEVEL ~ 10
should normally expand all nodes expect there are nodes which are
indented deeper than 10.
</li></ul>

<p>Note 1: This command switches off auto. expanding of the method-buffer
if <code>ecb-expand-methods-switch-off-auto-expand</code> is not nil. But it
can be switched on again quickly with
<code>ecb-toggle-auto-expand-tag-tree</code> or <kbd>[C-c . a]</kbd>.
</p>
<p>Note 2: All this is only valid for file-types parsed by semantic. For
other file types which are parsed by imenu or etags (see
<code>ecb-process-non-semantic-files</code>) <var>FORCE-ALL</var> is always true!
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-dump_002dsemantic_002dtoplevel"></a>Command: <strong>dump-semantic-toplevel</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Dump the current semantic-tags in special buffer and display them.
</p></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dt><a name="index-eshell_002dcurrent_002dbuffer_002dsync"></a>Command: <strong>eshell-current-buffer-sync</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Synchronize the eshell with the directory of current source-buffer.
This is only done if the eshell is currently visible in the
compile-window of ECB and if either this function is called
interactively or <code>ecb-eshell-buffer-sync</code> is not nil.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-eshell_002drecenter"></a>Command: <strong>eshell-recenter</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Recenter the eshell window so that the prompt is at the buffer-end.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-expand_002ddirectory_002dnodes"></a>Command: <strong>expand-directory-nodes</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Set the expand level of the nodes in the ECB-directories-buffer. For
argument LEVEL see <code>ecb-expand-methods-nodes</code>.
</p>
<p>Be aware that for deep structured paths and a lot of source-paths this
command can last a long time - depending on machine- and
disk-performance.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-goto_002dwindow_002danalyse"></a>Command: <strong>goto-window-analyse</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Make the ECB-analyse window the current window.

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-goto_002dwindow_002dcompilation"></a>Command: <strong>goto-window-compilation</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Goto the ecb compilation window <code>ecb-compile-window</code>.

<dd><p>Make the ECB-directories window the current window. If
<code>ecb-use-speedbar-instead-native-tree-buffer</code> is <code>dir</code> then
goto to the speedbar-window.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-goto_002dwindow_002decb_002dby_002dsmart_002dselection"></a>Command: <strong>goto-window-ecb-by-smart-selection</strong></dt>
<dd><p>selects a special ecb-browsing-window by smart selection. The command offers a
list of all special ecb-windows by buffer-name. Selecting the buffer-name will
select the displaying window. Which special ecb-windows are offered depends on
the currently selected window: If not a special ecb-window is the currently
selected-window then all edit-windows are offered in canonical order (means
from top-left to button-right). If an ecb-window is the currently
selected-window then all other(!) special ecb-windows are offered, beginning
with the next special ecb-window to the current ecb-window (the following
special ecb-windows also in canonical order). If there is only one senseful
destination-ecb-window then this window is immediately selected, without
confirmation (e.g.: There are two special ecb-windows and point stays in one
of them. Or there is only one ecb-window and point stays either in one of the
edit-windows or in the compile-window).
</p>
<p>If optional argument USE-IMMEDIATE-COMPLETION is nil then all possible
destination-windows are displayed in the message-area and only hitting TAB
offers completion. If USE-IMMEDIATE-COMPLETION is not nil then all possible
destinations are immediately shown in a completion-buffer.
</p></dd></dl>

the same as if <code>ecb-mouse-click-destination</code> is set to
<code>last-point</code>.
</p></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dt><a name="index-goto_002dwindow_002dhistory"></a>Command: <strong>goto-window-history</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Make the ECB-history window the current window.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-goto_002dwindow_002dmethods"></a>Command: <strong>goto-window-methods</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Make the ECB-methods window the current window. If
<code>ecb-use-speedbar-instead-native-tree-buffer</code> is <code>method</code>
then goto to the speedbar-window.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-goto_002dwindow_002dsources"></a>Command: <strong>goto-window-sources</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Make the ECB-sources window the current window. If

<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- Filter by extension:
Just insert the extension you want the History-buffer being filtered.
Insert the extension without leading dot!

</li><li>- Filter by regexp:
Insert the filter as regular expression.

</li><li>- No filter:
This means to display an entry for all currently living file-buffers.
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-jde_002ddisplay_002dclass_002dat_002dpoint"></a>Command: <strong>jde-display-class-at-point</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Display in the ECB-methods-buffer the contents (methods, attributes
etc...) of the class which contains the definition of the &ldquo;thing&rdquo;
under point (this can be a variable-name, class-name, method-name,
attribute-name). This function needs the same requirements to work as
the method-completion feature of JDEE (see
<code>jde-complete</code>)!. The source-file is searched first in
<code>jde-sourcepath</code>, then in <code>jde-global-classpath</code>, then in
<var>$CLASSPATH</var>, then in current-directory.
</p>
<p>Works only for classes where the source-code (i.e. the *.java-file) is
available.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-maximize_002dwindow_002danalyse"></a>Command: <strong>maximize-window-analyse</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Maximize the ECB-analyse-window. I.e. delete all other ECB-windows, so
only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are visible (and maybe a
compile-window). Works also if the ECB-analyse-window is not visible
in current layout.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-maximize_002dwindow_002ddirectories"></a>Command: <strong>maximize-window-directories</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Maximize the ECB-directories-window, i.e. delete all other
ECB-windows, so only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are visible
(and maybe a compile-window). Works also if the ECB-directories-window
is not visible in current layout.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-maximize_002dwindow_002dsources"></a>Command: <strong>maximize-window-sources</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Maximize the ECB-sources-window, i.e. delete all other ECB-windows, so
only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are visible (and maybe a
compile-window). Works also if the ECB-sources-window is not visible
in current layout.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-maximize_002dwindow_002dmethods"></a>Command: <strong>maximize-window-methods</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Maximize the ECB-methods-window, i.e. delete all other ECB-windows, so
only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are visible (and maybe a
compile-window). Works also if the ECB-methods-window is not visible
in current layout.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-maximize_002dwindow_002dhistory"></a>Command: <strong>maximize-window-history</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Maximize the ECB-history-window, i.e. delete all other ECB-windows, so
only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are visible (and maybe a
compile-window). Works also if the ECB-history-window is not visible
in current layout.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-maximize_002dwindow_002dspeedbar"></a>Command: <strong>maximize-window-speedbar</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Maximize the ECB-speedbar-window, i.e. delete all other ECB-windows,
so only one ECB-window and the edit-window(s) are visible (and maybe a
compile-window). Does nothing if the speedbar-window is not visible
within the ECB-frame.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-methods_002dfilter"></a>Command: <strong>methods-filter</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Apply a filter to the Methods-buffer to reduce the number of entries.
So you get a better overlooking. There are six choices:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Filter by protection:
Just insert the protection you want the Methods-buffer being filtered:
private, protected or public!

</li><li> Filter by regexp:
Insert the filter as regular expression.

</li><li> Filter by tag-class:
You can filter by the tag-classes of current major-mode. The available
tag-classes come from the variable
<code>semantic--symbol-&gt;name-assoc-list</code>. The are normally methods,
variables etc.

</li><li> Filter by current type:
In languages which have types like Java or C++ this filter displays
only the current type and all its members (e.g. attributes and
methods). If ECB can not identify the current type in the
source-buffer or in the methods-window then nothing will be done.

</li><li> Filter by a filter-function:   
Such a function gets two arguments: a tag and the source-buffer of
this tag. If the tag should be displayed (i.e. not being filtered out)
then the function has to return not nil otherwise nil.

</li><li> No special filter:
This means to display all tags specified with the option
<code>ecb-show-tokens</code>. If currently some of the above filters are
applied they will be all removed.

</li><li> Delete the last added:
This removes only the topmost filter-layer, means that filter added
last.
</li></ul>

<p>The protection-, current-type- and the tag-class-filter are only
available for semantic-supported sources.
</p>
<p>Be aware that the tag-list specified by the option
<code>ecb-show-tags</code> is the basis of all filters, i.e. tags which are
excluded by that option will never be shown regardless of the filter
type here!
</p>
<p>All tags which match the applied filter(s) will be displayed in the
Methods-buffer.
</p>
<p>If called with a prefix-argument or when optional arg INVERSE is not
nil then an inverse filter is applied to the Methods-buffer, i.e. all
tags which do NOT match the choosen filter will be displayed in the
Methods-buffer!
</p>
<p>Per default the choosen filter will be applied on top of already
existing filters. This means that filters applied before are combined
with the new filter. This behavior can changed via the option
<code>ecb-methods-filter-replace-existing</code>. But regardless of the
setting in <code>ecb-methods-filter-replace-existing</code> applying one of
the not-inverse filters protection, tag-class or current-type always
replaces exactly already existing filters of that type. On the other
hand applying more than one inverse tag-class- or protection-filter
can make sense.
</p>
<p>Such a filter is only applied to the current source-buffer, i.e. each
source-buffer can have its own tag-filters.
</p>
<p>The current active filter will be displayed in the modeline of the
Methods-buffer [regexp, prot (= protection), tag-class, function (=
filter-function)]. If an inverse filter has been applied then this is
signalized by a preceding caret ^. If currently more than 1 filter is
applied then always the top-most filter is displayed in the modeline
but the fact of more than 1 filter is visualized by the number of the
filters - included in parens. You can see all currently applied
filters by moving the mouse over the filter-string in modeline of the
Methods-buffer: They will displayed as help-echo.
</p>
<p>See the option <code>ecb-default-tag-filter</code> if you search for
automatically applied default-tag-filters.

<dt><a name="index-rebuild_002dmethods_002dbuffer"></a>Command: <strong>rebuild-methods-buffer</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Updates the methods buffer with the current buffer after deleting the
complete previous parser-information, means no semantic-cache is used!
Point must stay in an edit-window otherwise nothing is done. This
method is merely needed for semantic parsed buffers if semantic parses
not the whole buffer because it reaches a not parse-able code or for
buffers not supported by semantic but by imenu or etags.
</p>
<p>Examples when a call to this function can be necessary:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If an Elisp-file is parsed which contains in the middle a defun X
where the closing ) is missing then semantic parses only until this
defun X is reached and you will get an incomplete ECB-method buffer.
In such a case you must complete the defun X and then call this
function to completely reparse the Elisp-file and rebuild the ECB
method buffer!

</li><li> For not semantic supported buffers which can be parsed by imenu or
etags (see <code>ecb-process-non-semantic-files</code>) because for these
buffers there is no built-in auto-rebuild mechanism. For these buffers
this command calls <code>ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer-for-non-semantic</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>For non-semantic-sources supported by etags the option
<code>ecb-auto-save-before-etags-methods-rebuild</code> is checked before
rescanning the source-buffer and rebuilding the methods-buffer.
</p>
<p>If point is in one of the ecb-windows or in the compile-window then
this command rebuids the methods-buffer with the contents of the
source-buffer the last selected edit-window.

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-redraw_002dlayout"></a>Command: <strong>redraw-layout</strong> <em>&amp;optional ARG</em></dt>
<dd><p>Redraw the ECB screen.
</p>
<p>Do not call this command from elisp-program but only interactively!
</p>
<p>Called without a prefix-argument the state of the ECB-frame-layout
will preserved. This means:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- The state of compile-window (hidden or visible) will be preserved but
if visible then the height will be as specified in
<code>ecb-compile-window-height</code>.

</li><li>- The state of the ECB-windows will be preserved (hidden or visible) but
if visible then the sizes will be as specified in the layout (and with
the options <code>ecb-windows-width</code> and <code>ecb-windows-height</code>) or
as stored with <code>ecb-store-window-sizes</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>If called with ONE prefix-argument (<kbd>[C-u]</kbd>) then the layout will
be drawn with all ECB-windows and also with a visible compile-window
(when <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is not nil). The
splitting-state of the edit-area will be preserved.
</p>
<p>If called with TWO prefix-arguments (i.e. hitting <kbd>[C-u]</kbd> twice:
(<kbd>[C-u]</kbd> <kbd>[C-u]</kbd>) then an emergency-redraw will be performed.
This means the same as if called with one prefix-argument (s.a.) but
the splitting-state of the edit-area will NOT be preserved but all
edit-windows besides the current one will be deleted. Use this only if
there are some anomalies after standard redraws!
</p>
<p>If the variable <code>ecb-redraw-layout-quickly</code> is not nil then the
redraw is done by the <code>ecb-redraw-layout-quickly</code> function,
otherwise by <code>ecb-redraw-layout-full</code>.
</p>
<p>Please not: It&rsquo;s strongly recommended to use the quick redraw only if
you have really slow machines where a full redraw takes several
seconds because the quick redraw is not really safe and has some
annoying drawbacks! On normal machines the full redraw should be done
in &lt;&lt; 1s so there should be no need for the quick version!

</p>
<ul class="no-bullet">
<li>- Filter by extension:
Just insert the extension you want the Sources-buffer being filtered.
Insert the extension without leading dot!

</li><li>- Filter by regexp:
Insert the filter as regular expression.

This means to display an entry for every file in the current selected
directory (all except these filter already filtered out by

<dt><a name="index-store_002dwindow_002dsizes"></a>Command: <strong>store-window-sizes</strong> <em>&amp;optional FIX</em></dt>
<dd><p>Stores the sizes of the ECB windows for the current layout. The size
of the ECB windows will be set to their stored values when

To reset the window sizes to their default values call
<code>ecb-restore-default-window-sizes</code>. Please read also the
documentation of <code>ecb-layout-window-sizes</code>!
</p>
<p>The windows sizes are stored per default as fractions of current
frame-width and -height of the ecb-frame, so the stored values will
&ldquo;work&rdquo; for other frame sizes too. If a permanent compile-window is
visible then ECB will tell you that window-sizes should be stored with
hidden compile-window and ask you if you want proceed; if you proceed
then the window-heights will be stored as fractions of current
(frame-height minus current visible compile-window-height) so you
should ensure that the current compile-window has its standard-height
as specified in <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code>!. If <var>FIX</var> is not
nil (means called with a prefix argument) then always the fixed values
of current width and height are stored!
